## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Automated GitHub release workflow

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Direct tile stitcher for large acquisitions (500+ tiles)**: New memory-efficient code path that bypasses SparseImageServer entirely, preventing OOM errors that occurred with 1600+ tiles even on 64 GB systems
- **OME-ZARR output format**: Cloud-native directory-based format with Blosc compression (zstd, lz4, lz4hc, blosclz, zlib)
- **CompositorImageServer**: Read-only ImageServer backed by spatial index and bounded reader pool, enabling memory-efficient OME-TIFF output for large acquisitions via the existing PyramidImageWriter
- **TileSpatialIndex**: Grid-based O(1) tile lookup replacing the O(N) linear scan in SparseImageServer
- **TileReaderPool**: LRU cache of open ImageReader instances (max 8), bounding file handle usage regardless of tile count
- **ChunkCompositor**: On-demand pixel compositing from source tiles with white background support for RGB
- **ZarrOutputWriter**: Direct JZarr chunk writing with NGFF 0.4 metadata for the ZARR code path
- **PyramidLevelGenerator**: Generates downsampled pyramid levels by 2x area averaging from written chunks
- **BlendStrategy interface**: Extensible overlap handling (initial: OverwriteBlendStrategy matching existing behavior)
- GUI output format selection (OME-TIFF or OME-ZARR)
- Automatic compression mapping from TIFF types to ZARR equivalents
- Multi-threaded parallel tile writing for ZARR format

### Changed
- `PyramidImageWriter.createZarrCompressor()` changed from private to public for reuse by direct stitcher
- `StitchingWorkflow.run()` now routes to DirectTileStitcher when tile count >= 500
- Large acquisitions automatically use the direct path; small acquisitions use the existing SparseImageServer path unchanged

### Performance
- Memory usage for 1600-tile acquisitions: ~40 MB steady state (vs 2-4+ GB with SparseImageServer)
- Tile lookup: O(1) via spatial grid (vs O(N) linear scan per tile request)
- Maximum 8 open file handles regardless of tile count (vs 1600)
- Both OME-TIFF and OME-ZARR output supported for large acquisitions
